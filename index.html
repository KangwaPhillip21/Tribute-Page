            <strong>Preface/strong> - this book is an introdution to React Native using 
              javascript framework for building mobile apps. With the existing knowledge of javascript
              ,React Native after going through the book you will be able to make and deploy mobile apps 
              that can run on both Andriod and iOS
            
             .

            <strong>2022</strong> - "Chapter 1."What is React Native?
            React Native is classfield as a Javascript framework for coding real
            natively redefinig mobile apps for iOS and Andriod.its all basically on 
            React,facebook's javascript
             aims for building user inerface,rather than aiming for the browser,it targets
             mobile platforms [Web developers] can now write mobile apps
             that look or feel Native all in the work of Java script library we all have
             React Native makes it easy to simultaneously develop for  iOS and Andriod User.
             
             

             Similar to React Native for the web,some application are written using 
             a mixture of Javascript and XML-esque markup 
             also known as JSX.Then,under the hood,the React Native "bridge"
             involves the native redefinig APIs on Objectives-C (FOR  iOS) or Java
             (for Andriod).Thus,your application to render using real mobile UI components
             ,not webviews, and will look and feel like any other mobile aps on any device
             React Native also access javascrupt interface for for platform APIs
             ,so your React Native apps can process through other platform features like
              the phone camera ,or the User's Locatin.


              React Native currently supports both iOS and Andriod ,aand has 
              the potential to expand to future platforms as well.In this book,we
              are going to cover both iOS and Andriod . The vast majority of the code
               we write will cross-platform.And yes you can really 
               use React Native
                to build production-ready 
                mobile applications!some anecdo:facebook,palantir,and TaskRabbit 
                are already using it in prodution for  user-facing apllications.  </thead><thead></thead>
